## Description

This is a 3-server web infrastructure that is secured, monitored, and serves encrypted traffic.

## Specifics About This FLOW

+ What are firewalls for.<br/> Firewalls are built for securing internal network from unwanted traffic with a specific logic that's built into the firewall.

+ Why is the traffic served over HTTPS.<br/> Traffic is served over HTTPS because as we know that it's fully secured using the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt the data of the costumer, sending it to the server in the safest way possible without getting any leakage 'any possibilty of MITM attack will fade'. 

+ What monitoring is used for.<br/> The monitoring clients are for monitoring the servers and the external network. They analyse the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health, and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected. 

## Issues with this infrastructure

+ Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue.<br/> No it's not an ISSUE! Load balancer can inspect the traffic and can do a better job of load balancing. It also means your load balancer is responsible for dealing with slow clients, broken SSL implementations and general Internet flakiness. It's likely your load balancer is better resourced to do this than your back end servers. It also means that the SSL certs that the world sees are all on the load balancer (which hopefully makes them easier to manage).

+ Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue.<br/> Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.

+ Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem.<br/> Not being prone to good scalability because servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU
